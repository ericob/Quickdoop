Quickdoop

As of now, this is a realtively simple script that automates the
steps necessary to set up a single-node hadoop cluster.

These steps were taken almost completely from Michael Noll's tutorial, 
http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster/
Figuring out how to automate things like passwd and adduser was all me
- with some frustratingly bad help from google.


To use this, download all the files into a folder on a desired machine
(virtual or otherwise). Open up a terminal and run:
    sudo ./install.sh

A new user "hduser" will be created with the password "hadoop" that
has the ability to use hadoop. Run
    su hduser
To test this out without explicitly logging into the account.

WARNING: Please only test this out in a virtual machine or a new
installation you don't care much about. I've tested it successfully on
new installations of Ubuntu 11.10 and Lubuntu 12.04 beta (running on
virtual machines), though I have have no idea what it'll do to other
systems. At this point it's not very robust, so use at your own risk.
